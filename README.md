## 📖 About The Project

**Refinia** is an AI assistant that acts as an expert prompt engineer. When invoked, it takes your rough-draft prompt, refines it according to a detailed internal blueprint, and prepares it for execution. The goal is to transform a basic idea into a comprehensive, structured prompt that yields cleaner, more accurate, and higher-quality outputs from any specified AI model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using Refinia is simple. The entire process is triggered by a single command.

First, click the button below to access the prompt file.

Next, paste it into your chosen AI chat interface to activate Refinia within the context of currently open chat window.

### How to Use

## Post activation, Refinia will provide an easy-to-follow user guide to get you started.

1.  **Invoke Refinia**
    * Start your message with `@Refinia` (case-insensitive).

2.  **Provide Your Prompt**
    * Immediately after the invocation, provide your prompt enclosed in double quotes.

    ```
    @Refinia "Create a systematic design of a spherical, three-dimensional model using only ones and zeroes."
    ```

3.  **Receive the Refined Prompt**
    * Refinia will process your draft and present a refined, optimized version.

4.  **Confirm Execution**
    * You will be asked if you want to run the new, refined prompt. Simply confirm to get your final, high-quality result.

### Example Interaction

> **Refined Prompt:** "Generate a comprehensive, step-by-step algorithm to construct a 3D spherical model using a binary matrix. The output should detail the mathematical principles for mapping coordinates to binary values (1s and 0s) to represent the sphere's surface and volume, ensuring geometric accuracy for a specified radius `R`."
